As systems become increasingly sophisticated, their state spaces become larger and the use of analysis and simulation techniques is impossible by a single-processor machine. Distributed simulation seems the natural way to afford this problem. However, the main bottleneck of distributed simulation is the management, compilation and deployment of large scale models. This paper presents the experimentation results of a compiler of large scale Petri-net based models.
