I'm a Ph.D. student at the [University of Zaragoza](https://www.unizar.es) working under the supervision of [Ricardo J. Rodriguez](https://webdiis.unizar.es/~ricardo/) with the [reversea.me](https://www.reversea.me) research team. My research focuses on AI applications in cybersecurity, specifically on detecting algorithmically generated domains (AGDs) using machine learning techniques and Large Language Models like ChatGPT, Claude, and MistralAI. I'm always open to collaborations with other universities and companies.

During my doctoral studies, I completed a research visit at [Ruhr University Bochum](https://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/en) in Germany under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Kevin Borgolte](https://kevin.borgolte.me/), where I explored novel applications of LLMs for binary decompilation via intermediate representations.

Before pursuing research, I worked for almost two years at [Teltronic SAU](https://www.teltronic.es/en/) as a cybersecurity engineer, leading cybersecurity strategy and compliance for LTE product lines. I hold a bachelor's degree in Computer Science Engineering from the [University of Zaragoza](https://www.unizar.es) (graduated with honors in Artificial Intelligence) and a master's degree in Cybersecurity Research from the [University of León](https://www.unileon.es).

Outside my academic work, I have a background in music from the [Conservatorio Profesional de Música de Zaragoza (CPMZ)](https://www.cpmzaragoza.com/), where I learned to play the bassoon. I currently serve as first bassoon for the [Zaragoza City Hall band](https://bandaclubsocialzaragoza.com/banda-de-musica/).

I'm passionate about the Pyrenees and outdoor activities. When I'm not working, you'll often find me hiking mountain trails or engaging in sports like running, bouldering, and rowing. I row with the first team at [Os'Nabaters](https://www.facebook.com/p/Os-Nabaters-do-flumen-100071789451571/) rowing club in the Men's Eight.
