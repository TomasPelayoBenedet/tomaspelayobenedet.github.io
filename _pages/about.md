Tomas is a Ph.D. canditate at the [University of Zaragoza](https://www.unizar.es) under the supervision of [Ricardo J. Rodriguez](https://webdiis.unizar.es/~ricardo/) in the research team [reversea.me](https://www.reversea.me). His research research focuses on malware detection in networks using machine learning techniques such as neural networks and LLMs (e.g. ChatGPT, Claude, MistralAI...), always open to collaborations with other universities or companies.

Before dedicating himself to research, he worked for almost two years as a cybersecurity engineer at [Teltronic SAU](https://www.teltronic.es/en/). Prior to all this, he obtained his bachelor's degree in computer science engineering at the [University of Zaragoza](https://www.unizar.es) and his master's degree in Cybersecurity Research at the [University of Le√≥n](https://www.unileon.es).

Outside of his scientific life, he has studies in music ([CPMZ](https://www.cpmzaragoza.com/)), allowing him to play the bassoon and currently be a member of the [Zaragoza City Hall band](https://bandaclubsocialzaragoza.com/banda-de-musica/).

Parallel to his academic life, he is a lover of the Pyrenees and sports. Any excuse is good for a bit of hiking on any trail the Pyrenees have to offer, weather permitting. Among the sports he is currently focusing on are running, bouldering and rowing, belonging to the rowing team [OsNabaters](https://www.facebook.com/p/Os-Nabaters-do-flumen-100071789451571/).
